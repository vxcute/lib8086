# lib8086

This is just a repo where I am trying to implement 8086 decoder, disassembler and emulator, its also because I am studying this amazing [Performance-Aware Programming By Casey Muratori](https://www.computerenhance.com/) where in part 2 he builds a 
8086 emulator, I really recommend taking the course it will make you a better programmer or I just think it will make me so :).
